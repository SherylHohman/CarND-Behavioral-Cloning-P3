# neural network for behavioural cloning driving behaviour that was caputred in driving_log.csv
# reads training data from driving_log.csv
# trains a neural network from that data
# saves trained model as model.h5
# model.h5 can then be used to autonomously drive the car in the simulator that was used to produce the training data.
